daemonproxy
===========

A tight eficient process manager driven by external scripts

philosophy
==========

This process manager is written in the spirit of daemontools,
much like runit, s6, perp, and others.

Their common philosophy is that the one true way to monitor a
daemon is for the daemon to be a child of a process manager,
such that the process manager receives SIGCHLD the moment the
daemon exits, sees the exit status of the daemon, and can take
appropriate steps to restart the daemon.

The other semi-common philosophy is that the process manager
should be able to restart a daemon connected to the same output
pipe (for logging) that it was originally connected to, and
also give it an identical environment each time it is started.
(this is a thing that is hard to do when you run init scripts
 from cron jobs or other sloppy methods like that)

The point at which daemonproxy diverges from the rest is that
it generates a stream of events which can be piped to an
external script that does the actual service-management logic,
and is in turn controlled by this script.  Thus, it is a proxy
for daemon management.

configuration
=============

While the filesystem-based configuration of daemontools and friends
is a nice simple and unix-friendly way to configure services,
there are times when setting up a tree of special scripts,
directories, and control files with special filesystem flags
is something of a hassle.  Particularly when you want to commit
them to version control (losing the special permission flags),
or want them to live on a read-only filesystem.

While each of those tools have various workarounds available,
nothing beats a plain old config file, which can be committed
to version control, stored on read-only media, or even generated
by a script on the fly.  daemonproxy makes this especially easy
by even allowing the configuration to come from stdin.

In fact, daemonproxy's config file isn't really even a config
file; it is just a stream of commands that might happen to be
read from a file (or stdin, or a variety of other inputs).
These commands might configure new services and they might
start some of them.

But, the best feature of all is that commands can configure a
"controller", which connects back to daemonproxy to dynamically
issue more commands in response to events.

daemon management
=================

daemonproxy is named daemonproxy because it is acting as a proxy
for the actual service manager.  The service manager **you** want
to handle your special cases and needs is probably best written
as a script.  But, writing a process manager can be complicated,
and a fatal bug could orphan all your daemons and make a difficult
task of cleaning up the mess, or get stuck and stop performing its
duties.

daemonproxy takes over the important role of the parent process,
and can act as a watchdog for your script, while maintaining the
state of all the services and file handles that connect them to
their loggers.  It also condenses signals and other events into a
nice event stream (tab-delimited text) so your script doesn't have
to deal with the complications of signal handling, nonblocking I/O,
or waiting for children.  All you have to do is read stdin and
write stdout!

init replacement
================

daemonproxy is designed to be a suitable replacement for process 1.
It uses a minimal amount of RAM, it can allocate all its dynamic
memory on startup (the table sizes can be controlled with command
line switches) and it has options to attempt recovery on lesser
errors, or to exec() to a cleanup script in case of fatal error.

It is a single-thread process written in non-blocking style as a
collection of state machines, and it has no external library
dependencies, so it is a natural fit for static compilation.
It also has relatively few lines of code!  Memory footprint numbers
are not yet available.

other uses
==========

However, daemonproxy is certainly not limited to running as init!
One of my main design goals is to use it for background jobs that
web services want to run.  A web service sometimes needs to kick
off a background job, and then needs a way to check back on it
to see if it is still running, whether it completed successfully,
and maybe find the name of the output file (or screen session) it
is using.

daemonproxy is a perfect fit for this, and accepts commands for
creating new services, attaching arbitrary metadata to them,
querying their PID and exit status, and the timestamps when
they started or exited.
